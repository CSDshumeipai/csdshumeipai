To test the limits of this project, early Pokemon music was an excellent candidate due to its complex harmonies with only 3 voices. Mark Benis was kind enough to lend me [some of his transcriptions of the Pokemon Red and Blue soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WG9V6C1Aew), but I also transcribed two pieces from Pokemon Gold and Silver.

Note that these two transcriptions were made by someone with no previous transcribing experience. There may be several stylistic errors, but I can almost certainly say that the notes themselves are 90% correct.  

The transcriptions were made based on the instructions in [this blog post](https://www.markbenis.com/post/how-to-transcribe-retro-video-game-music). Instead of Audio Overload, the program used was Foobar2000 with Game Emu Player extension due to better playback controls (speed, pitch, muting channels).
